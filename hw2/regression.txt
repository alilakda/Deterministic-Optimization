model robustregression !the name of the model
uses "mmxprs"; !gain access to the Xpress-Optimizer solver for solving linear programs

declarations !you may need to define more variables
  Objective:linctr !Objective is declared as a linear constraint, which should be defined later in the code.
  coeff = 1 .. 3 ! number of coefficients in the regression model
  x : array(1..100,1..2) of real ! data points x
  y : array(1..100) of real ! data points label y
  b : array(coeff) of mpvar ! variables for the coefficients of the linear classifier, corresponds to beta's in the homework
  z : array(1..100) of mpvar   !you may need to define more variables
  end-declarations

initializations from 'regression.dat'
    x y
end-initializations

forall (i in 1..3)
    b(i) is_free ! remember that Xpress always assumes a variable to be nonnegative unless defined otherwise


! define Objective function
Objective := sum(l in 1..100)z(l)


! reformulate the original objective function as linear inequalities
forall(i in 1..100)
z(i) >= y(i) - b(1) - b(2)*x(i, 1) - b(3)*x(i, 2)

forall(k in 1..100)
-z(k) <= y(k) - b(1) - b(2)*x(k, 1) - b(3)*x(k, 2)



! now we are ready to invoke the solver to minimize the objective function
minimize (Objective)


! if your model runs correctly, the following two lines of texts should be printed in Output/Input tab on the right
writeln("Begin running model")
writeln("End running model")
! then the optimal solution of the problem should be printed in Output/Input tab
forall (i in coeff)
    writeln("b(",i,")=",getsol(b(i)))
writeln("obj", getobjval)


end-model
